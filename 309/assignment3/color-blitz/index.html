		<p>The players connect with their phones and compete by comparing reaction times. Each player will have the same 5 colored figures to choose from during each round.</p>

		<p>At the start of a round, the main screen will show a picture depicting two colored figures. Depending on the picture, a certain figure will be the right choice for that round. After a certain time limit, the players who chose the correct figure receive points (the first player to answer gets double points) and the players who chose an incorrect figure lose points.</p>

		<p>At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.</p>

		<p>The 5 colored figures are:</p>

		<p>There are 2 different types of pictures:</p>

		<div id="type1">

			<img src='img/type1.jpg'></img>

		</div>

		<div id="type2">

			<p><b>Type 2:</b> Both figures in the picture are depicted in the wrong color. In this case, the correct figure to choose is <b>the figure that has neither its shape nor its color depicted:</b></p>

			<img src='img/type2.jpg'></img>
